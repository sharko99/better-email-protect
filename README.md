# Dynamic Email Replacement Script

## Description
This script dynamically replaces placeholders in the DOM with an email address. Initially, all instances of `{{EMAIL}}` are replaced with "Email address loading...". Once the page is fully loaded, these placeholders are then replaced with the actual email address, which is composed from separate variables.

## Usage
Include this script in your HTML and ensure jQuery is loaded. The script will automatically execute on document ready and window load events.

**Example:**
To use, simply place `{{EMAIL}}` in your HTML where you want the email to appear.

## Dependencies
- **jQuery:** This script requires jQuery to be loaded before its execution.

## Notes
- This is meant for basic email obfuscation and may not provide strong protection against sophisticated bots.
- Ensure you replace the 'localPart' and 'domain' variables with your actual email parts.
- Be cautious with `.html()` replacements as they can have unintended side effects on complex websites.
